# Software Specification for ArtUSD Stablecoin Lending and Staking Protocol

## **1. Overview**  
This specification outlines a lending and staking protocol for the ArtUSD stablecoin, a stablecoin pegged 1:1 to USDC, utilizing a shared liquidity pool (ArtUSD/USDC) to support the stablecoin system. The system includes a lending protocol with lending and borrowing modes, a staking protocol with a farming mode, and a shared liquidity pool to facilitate market-making and maintain the stablecoin peg.

## **2. System Components**

### 2.1 Shared Liquidity Pool
- **Purpose**: Acts as a centralized pool for ArtUSD and USDC to support lending, staking, and stablecoin system operations.
- **Functionality**:
  - Accepts deposits of ArtUSD and USDC from lending and staking protocols.
  - Provides liquidity for market-making and arbitrage activities in the stablecoin systemâ€™s order book exchange to maintain the 1:1 peg between ArtUSD and USDC.
- **Management**:
  - Tracks total ArtUSD and USDC balances.
  - Ensures liquidity availability for short- and long-term stablecoin system support.

### 2.2 Lending Protocol
#### 2.2.1 Lending Mode
- **Purpose**: Allows depositors to earn annual interest by depositing ArtUSD or USDC.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Deposits**: Users deposit ArtUSD or USDC, which are transferred to the shared liquidity pool.
  - **Interest**: Depositors earn annual interest calculated and paid in ArtUSD.
  - **Use of Funds**: Deposited funds are used for short-term support of the stablecoin system.
- **Requirements**:
  - User interface for depositing ArtUSD/USDC and viewing accrued interest.
  - Smart contract to calculate and distribute interest periodically.
  - Integration with the shared liquidity pool for fund transfers.

#### 2.2.2 Borrowing Mode
- **Purpose**: Allows borrowers to obtain ArtUSD loans by collateralizing crypto assets.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Collateral**: Borrowers deposit various crypto assets into a dedicated asset fund pool.
  - **Loan-to-Value (LTV)**: Borrowing amount is calculated based on the LTV ratio of the collateral.
  - **Loans**: Borrowers receive ArtUSD loans.
  - **Interest**: Borrowers pay annual interest in USDC, serving as a profit source for the stablecoin system.
  - **Collateral Management**: Collateral is held in an independent asset fund pool. In case of bad debt, collateral is liquidated to cover losses.
- **Requirements**:
  - Smart contract to calculate LTV, issue loans, and manage interest payments.
  - Collateral valuation mechanism using real-time market data (e.g., oracles).
  - Liquidation mechanism to sell collateral in case of default.
  - User interface for collateral deposit, loan issuance, and repayment tracking.

### 2.3 Staking Protocol
#### 2.3.1 Farming Mode
- **Purpose**: Allows depositors to earn yield by staking ArtUSD or USDC with varying lock-up periods.
- **Functionality**:
  - **Deposits**: Users stake ArtUSD or USDC, which are transferred to the shared liquidity pool.
  - **Yield**: Users earn farming yield in ArtUSD, with rates determined by the lock-up period (longer lock-ups yield higher returns).
  - **Use of Funds**: Staked funds support both short- and long-term operations of the stablecoin system.
- **Requirements**:
  - Smart contract to manage staking, lock-up periods, and yield distribution.
  - User interface for selecting lock-up periods, staking assets, and tracking yields.
  - Integration with the shared liquidity pool for fund transfers.

## **3. Stablecoin System Integration**
- **Order Book Exchange**:
  - The shared liquidity pool provides ArtUSD and USDC for market-making and arbitrage activities.
  - Ensures the 1:1 peg between ArtUSD and USDC through automated market-making strategies.
- **Requirements**:
  - Integration with an order book exchange for real-time trading.
  - Smart contract for arbitrage to maintain peg stability.
  - Monitoring system to track pool balances and peg performance.

## **4. Technical Requirements**
- **Blockchain Platform**: Deployed on a compatible blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Solana, or equivalent).
- **Smart Contracts**:
  - Lending protocol: Deposit, interest calculation, loan issuance, collateral management, and liquidation.
  - Staking protocol: Staking, yield calculation, and lock-up management.
  - Shared liquidity pool: Fund tracking and transfer.
  - Stablecoin system: Peg maintenance and market-making.
- **Oracles**: Real-time price feeds for collateral valuation and peg maintenance.
- **Security**:
  - Audited smart contracts to prevent vulnerabilities.
  - Multi-signature wallets for asset fund pool management.
  - Emergency pause functionality for all protocols.
- **User Interface**:
  - Web/mobile interface for depositing, borrowing, staking, and tracking earnings.
  - Dashboard for viewing pool balances, interest/yield rates, and loan statuses.

## **5. Assumptions and Constraints**
- ArtUSD is fully backed and pegged 1:1 to USDC.
- Collateral assets are supported by reliable price oracles.
- The shared liquidity pool has sufficient capacity to handle deposits and withdrawals.
- Regulatory compliance is assumed to be handled outside this specification.

## **6. Future Considerations**
- Support for additional stablecoins or collateral types.
- Dynamic interest/yield rate adjustments based on market conditions.
- Integration with decentralized governance for protocol updates.
